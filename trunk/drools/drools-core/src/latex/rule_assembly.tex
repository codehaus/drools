\chapter{Rule Assembly API}
\label{rule.assembly}

\section{Introduction}

The DRL (Chapter~\vref{drl}) constructs rules using the
\emph{Rule Assembly API}.  This API may also be used
directly by applications that wish to programatically construct
\indexClass{Rule} instances without using the DRL.

The \texttt{org.drools.rule} package contains the classes
and interfaces that form the Rule Assembly API.  The two concrete
classes of note are \indexClass{Rule} and \indexClass{RuleSet}.
Other concrete classes used in the assembly of rules are
pulled from various semantic module implementations.

\section{Requirements}

Each \indexClass{Rule} is required to have at least one
\indexClass{Parameter} and a \indexClass{Consequence}.
Zero or more \indexClass{Condition} objects may be attached
to each \class{Rule}\footnote{Though, a \class{Rule} without a
\class{Condition} is not much of a rule.}.
