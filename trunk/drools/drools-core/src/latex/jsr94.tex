\section{Introduction}

The Java$^{TM}$ Rule-Engine API, known as \emph{JSR-94} is a
specification developed by the Java Community Process\index{Java
Community Process} (JCP\index{JCP|see Java Community Process})
which attempts to standardize the way that applications interact
with rule-engines.

\section{Scope}

JSR-94 only attempts to standardize the actual Java API for working
with rule-engines and does not address the authoring of rules at all.
Each rule-engine still has its own syntax for writing rules.  JSR-94
\emph{does} proscribe a method of loading a rule definition document
using a DOM \indexClass{Document} but does not speak as to the
content of the document being loaded.

The specification also does not address any details regarding the
underlying implementation or algorithms.  It simply provides a
consistent manner in which to obtain a rule session, manipulate
knowledge within it, and to fire rules.

\section{JSR-94 and Drools}

The JSR-94 binding for Drools is an optional module that provides a
thin wrapper around the client (Chapter~\vref{client.api}) and
administrative (Chapter~\vref{admin.api}) APIs.
