\section{Rules Engines}

Rules engines were created to solve the need for business rules
to be easier to create and maintain. Through the use of intelligent
algorithms (see Chapter \vref{algorithms}), some dedicate rules engine
can also produce efficiencies when working with a great amount of
rules, events and data.

A good rules engine allows the business rules and logic of a system
to be specified external to the system itself.  No longer must these
rules be codified by the developers.  Many rules engines even provide
natural-language or wizard-style GUIs for designing rules, allowing
product managers or business analysts to actually specify the logic.
Separation of concerns and responsibility is achieved by moving the 
business rule specification outside of the actual program logic.
Developers can
concern themselves with systems engineering while the analysts 
concentrate on the business logic.

There are currently many commercial and open-source implementations
of rules engines aside from \drools{}.  The commercial
vendors have undoubtedly good algorithms and have spent considerable
time and effort on the user interfaces and rule specification
languages.
