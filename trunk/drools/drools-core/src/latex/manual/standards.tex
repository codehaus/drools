\section{Standards}

\subsection{RuleML}

RuleML is a mark-up language for describing rules.  After brief
research, we decided that supporting RuleML was not a priority.

\subsection{JSR-94}

JSR-94 is the specification working its way through the Java Community
Process toward defining a common API for rules engines.  This
specification is not yet public, but \drools{} intends to support it 
when it is made available to implementors.
