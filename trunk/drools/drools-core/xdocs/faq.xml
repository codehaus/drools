    <section name="What is drools?">
      <p>
      <b>drools</b> is a dynamic rules engine for Java, based upon the
      Rete algorithm and supported by a pluggable semantics modules.

    <section name="What's Rete?">
      <p>
      Rete is an algorithm devised by Charlse Forgy in the early
      1980's to efficiently match conditions of rules when many
      objects are being observed by many rules.  It's basically
      a structure to allow progressive relational joins across
      tables.

    <section name="Relational joins?  I want objects!">
      <p>
      Yes, folks want objects, but Rete works in terms of
      tables and tuples.  Thus, I've modified the algorithm,
      named my adapatation <b>Rete-OO</b>, which is described
      in <a href="/pdf/rete-oo.pdf">this PDF document</a>.

    <section name="What's a Semantic Module?">
      <p>
      Rules are written against objects, but the concept of
      an 'object' is fairly arbitrary, and completely customizable
      using <b>Semantic Modules</b>.  A Java Semantic Module may
      regard any XML document simply as an object of type
      <i>org.dom4j.Document</i>, while an XML Semantic Module
      may differentiate between documents based upon their
      root element's name and namespace-uri.  It's up to you.

    <section name="How is drools designed?">
      <p>
      Information regarding the design and implementation of
      drools may be found in <a href="/pdf/drools-impl.pdf">this
      PDF document</a>.
