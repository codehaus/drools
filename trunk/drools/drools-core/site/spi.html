      The Semantic Provider Interface (SPI) allows for extending Drools to more natively
      support the semantics of your domain.  The SPI defines a handful of interfaces that
      may be implemented to create new rule primitives.   Rule primitives are the parts
      that are stitched together to form a concrete rule.

      <p>
      Each rule operates against some set of objects.  Each object may be categorized in one of many
      ways.  An XML documentment might be categorized based upon the root element when viewed within
      the semantics of XML.  But with the semantics of the Java language, each would simply be an
      instance of some <code>Document</code> class, indifferentiable from others.
      <p>
      <p>
      An <a href="TOP/api/org/drools/spi/ObjectType.html">ObjectType</a> implementation is required
      to contain only a single method, <a href="TOP/api/org/drools/spi/ObjectType.html#matches(java.lang.Object)">matches(...)</a>,
      which serves the same role as the <code>instanceof</code> operator in Java.  It inspects
      the given object and returns simple a boolean <code>true</code> if the object is considered
      to match the type or <code>false</code> if not.
      </p>

      <p>
      For example, an object-type used within an insurance system for a the employees of
      a company might be used to differentiate young employees from old employees.
      </p>

      <div class="code">
<pre>
public boolean matches(Object object)
{
    if ( ! object instanceof Employee )
    {
        return false
    }

    Employee employee = (Employee) object;

    return ( employee.getAge() > 50 );
}
</pre>
