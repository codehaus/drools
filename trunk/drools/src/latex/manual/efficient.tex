\section{Efficient Matching}

While it may be simple to create a rules engine that 
allows specification of business logic in a format
that is comfortable to business analysts, the matching
of the rules may still be problematic without a good
algorithm.

The rules engine must be made aware of its environment,
typically through a process called \emph{fact assertion}.
Fact assertion consists of the program asserting facts
into a rules session, or \emph{working memory}.

Whenever a fact is asserted, retracted or modified within 
the working memory, many rules may become candidates for 
firing, or may have become invalidated.  A simplistic
approach is to reevaluate all rules against the entirety
of the working memory.  This method is guaranteed to be
correct but will also certainly be sub-optimal.  Any
individual fact modification only affects a small number
of conditions in a small number of rules.  

Variations of the Rete algorithm allow the rules engine
to maintain a memory of the results of partial rule
matches across time.  Reevaluation of each condition
is no longer necessary, as the engine knows which conditions
might possibly change for each fact, and only those 
must be reevaluated.
