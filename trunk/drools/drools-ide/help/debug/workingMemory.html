  <IMG src="workingMemory.gif"/>
  <P/>
  The Working Memory shows all elements in the working memory of the Drools engine.

  Three actions are added to the right of the view, to customize what is shown:
  <UL>
    <LI>The Show Detail Pane action toggles the detail pane at the bottom of the view.</LI>
    <LI>The Show Logical Structure toggles showing the logical structure of the elements in the working memory, or all their details.  Logical structures allow for example visualizing sets of elements in a more obvious way.</LI>
    <LI>A drop down contains two actions to toggle the display of constants and static variables.</LI>
  </UL>
