  The most important features of the Drools Editor are:
  <UL>
    <LI>Syntax colouring: The Drools Editor offers some basic syntax colouring.</LI>
    <LI>Syntax checking: Drools files can be checked for consistence, and possible errors or warnings are shown in the Problems View. There are two way of checking Drools files:
      <UL>
        <LI>.drl files in a Drools Project are automatically checked when building the project. This occurs automatically when the Drools file is saved if the project uses automatic building.</LI>
        <LI>A Drools File can be checked manually (even outside a Drools Project) by selecting the Drools File and clicking the Check Drools File action.</LI>
      </UL>
      It is possible that a filter prevents the Drools errors from being displayed in the Problems View.  Select the Filters action in the Problems View and make sure that the Drools Error checkbox is checked.
