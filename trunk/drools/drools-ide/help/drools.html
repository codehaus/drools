  <H1>Drools Plugin</H1>
  This is the Drools Plugin.
  <P/>
  All .drl files in a Drools project are automatically checked for correctness when saved.
  <P/>
  You can create a new Drools Project by selecting File -> New -> Project ... which pops up a 'New Project'-dialog. Select the Drools Project item in the Drools folder and click Next. Fill in a name and click Finish. The new Drools Project should have been created.
  <P/>

  <P/>
  The newly created contains an example rule file (Rules.java.drl) in the src/rules dir and an example java file (DroolsTest.java) that can be used to execute the rules in a Drools engine in the folder src/java, in the com.sample package.  All the others jars that are necessary during execution are also added to the classpath in a custom classpath container called Drools Library [2.5].
  <P/>
  You can create e new Drools Java File by selecting File -> New -> Other ... which pops up a 'New'-dialog. Select the Drools Java File item in the Drools folder and click Next. Fill in a name and select the location where the Drools file should be created and click Finish. A new .java.drl file should have been created. This file already contains some xml that should be extended by adding new rulesets, rules, etc.
  <P/>
  Drools files (ending with .drl) are edited using the <A href="editor/editor.html">Drools Editor</A>. The editor offers some basic syntax colouring.
  <P/>
  Drools files can be checked for consistence, and possible errors or warnings are shown in the Problems View. There are two way of checking Drools files:
  <UL>
    <LI>.drl files in a Drools Project are automatically checked when building the project. This occurs automatically when the Drools file is saved if the project uses automatic building.</LI>
    <LI>A Drools File can be checked manually (even outside a Drools Project) by selecting the Drools File and clicking the Check Drools File action.</LI>
  </UL>
  <P/>
  When debugging an application using a Drools engine, three new views can be used to check the state of the Drools engine itself: the Working Memory View, the Agenda View and the Application Data View. To be able to use these views, either:
  <UL>
    <LI> Create a breakpoint in your code that is calling the WorkingMemory and select the WorkingMemory variable in the Variables debug view
    <LI> Create a breakpoint in the Drools org.drools.reteoo.WorkingMemoryImpl code itself (or any other code that is called from inside WorkingMemoryImpl). For example, the fireAllRules(AgendaFilter agendaFilter) method in the WorkingMemoryImpl class is a good candidate for a breakpoint, because you can pause the engine before firing a rule instance on the agenda.
  </UL>
  Whenever such a breakpoint is encountered, these views show the current state of the engine.
  <UL>
    <LI>The <A href="debug/workingMemory.html">Working Memory</A> shows all elements in the working memory of the Drools engine.</LI>
    <LI>The <A href="debug/agenda.html">Agenda View</A> shows all elements on the agenda. For each rule on the agenda, the rule name and bound variables are shown.</LI>
    <LI>The <A href="debug/applicationData.html">Application Data View</A> shows all application data currently defined in the Drools engine.</LI>
  </UL>
