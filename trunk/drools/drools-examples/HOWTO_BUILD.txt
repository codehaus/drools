HOWTO BUILD DROOLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build drools The Easy Way, you need a perl interpreter on your 
machine.  Most sane unixesque operating systems already have it 
installed.  Win32 users may use ActiveState Perl or some other version.

Simply run the build.pl script from this directory.

    [bob@melvin drools]$ ./build.pl

That will build the entire code base, including the HTML documentation.

If you wish to run tests, use this command:

    [bob@melvin drools]$ ./build.pl test

** IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PERL installed on your machine, you may invoke
ant without the build.pl.  Simply make sure that all of the .jar files
in the $DROOLS/lib/ directory are part of your $CLASSPATH.

Additionally, documentation not directly related to the usage of drools 
may be found in $DROOLS/src/latex/.  Refer to the LaTeX documentation 
for information regarding converting .tex files into .pdf, .ps or other
formats.
