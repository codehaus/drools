/**
 * Miss Manners Data Generator
 * 
 * The purpose of this program is to generate a file of make statements that can
 * be used as an input data set for the Miss Manners OPS5c program.
 * 
 * All input to this program will be interactively obtained from the user. The
 * file of make statements will be written to file manners.dat. The user
 * specifies how many guests there will be. Each guest's name will be a unique
 * integer. Each guest is assigned a sex at random. The user can specify the
 * total number of hobbies it is possible for a guest to have, and a lower limit
 * of the number of hobbies for a guest.
 * 
 * For instance, if the user chooses 10 hobbies and a lower limit of 3 hobbies,
 * each guest will have between 3 and 10 hobbies. The hobbies will be designated
 * with an integer. Finally, the user can specify the number of seats available.
 * 
 * The sex of the guests is assigned so that approximately half of the guests
 * are male and half are female.
 * 
 * This is based on the work of Tim Grose.
