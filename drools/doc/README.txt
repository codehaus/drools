Logo Files

If you needed to change the colors in the logo text, do so in the photoshop file, then drag the layer
text over to the illustrator file.  I did this work on Illustrator 9 and Photoshop 6.  

The only missing thing on the text is there is a setting called "faux bold" that I set on the final AI
file and did not get set again on the Photoshop original for the text.  So you need to set that if you
want the font to look the same when you drag it across. 

(Note that this is literally dragging and dropping the text across...)
