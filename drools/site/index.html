  <p>
  Drools  is an augmented implementation of Forgy's Rete algorithm tailored for 
  the Java language. Adapting Rete to an object-oriented interface allows for 
  more natural expression of business rules with regards to business objects. 
  </p>

  <p>
  More importantly, Drools provides for <i>declarative</i> logic programming
  and is flexible enough to match the semantics of your problem domain.  The
  various parts that compose a rule may be extended to lend domain-specific sense
  to the rule.
