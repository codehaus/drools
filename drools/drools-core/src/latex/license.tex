The Apache Software Foundation.  It is a commercial-friendly license

source or binary form.  While you are \emph{encouraged} to contribute
changes back to the project, you are by no means \emph{required} to
do so.   The Drools license is not viral or infectious.  It
does not alter how you license you own product.  If you have any
