  <section name="drools">
    <p>
    <code>drools</code> is an augmented implementation of Forgy's Rete algorithm,
    tailored for the object-oriented language of Java.  Adapting
    Rete to an object-oriented interface allows for more natural
    expression of business rules with regards to business objects.

    <subsection name="Rete-OO">

      <p>
      The <code>drools</code> engine uses a modified form of the Rete algorithm
      called the Rete-OO algorithm.  Internally, it operates using the same
      concepts and methods as Forgy's original, but adds some node types
      required for seemless integration with an object-oriented language.

    <subsection name="Semantics Provider Interface &amp; Framework">

      <p>
      At the core <code>drools</code> is purely an Rete-OO algorithmic
      engine.  The engine works in terms of very abstracted concepts,
      such as <code>FilterCondition</code>s, <code>Declaration</code>s and
      <code>FactExtractor</code>s.  Though the usage of concrete 
      <i>semantics modules</i> the algorithmic engine can be given any
      interface desired.
