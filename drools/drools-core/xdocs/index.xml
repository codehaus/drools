    <p>
    <code>drools</code> is an augmented implementation of Forgy's Rete algorithm
    tailored for the object-oriented language of Java.  Adapting
    Rete to an object-oriented interface allows for more natural
    expression of business rules with regards to business objects.

    <subsection name="Rete-OO">

      <p>
      The <code>drools</code> engine uses a modified form of the Rete algorithm
      called the Rete-OO algorithm.  Internally it operates using the same
      concepts and methods as Forgy's original but adds some node types
      required for seemless integration with an object-oriented language.

      <p>
      At the core, <code>drools</code> is purely an Rete-OO algorithmic
      engine.  The engine works in terms of very abstracted concepts,
      such as <a href="./apidocs/org/drools/spi/Condition.html">Conditions</a>, 
      <a href="./apidocs/org/drools/spi/ObjectType.html">ObjectTypes</a> and
      <a href="./apidocs/org/drools/spi/Extractor.html">Extractors</a>.  
      Concrete <i>semantic modules</i> are used to bind 
      application-specific semantics tightly to the internals of the 
      algorithmic engine.
