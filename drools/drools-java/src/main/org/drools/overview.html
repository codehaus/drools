	The <code>drools Logic Engine</code> is a semantic-model independent
	implementation of the Rete-OO algorithm, an object-oriented adaptation
	of Forgy's original Rete system.  
	</p>

	<p>
	The Rete-OO algorithm was created by Bob McWhirter, and is documented
	in the paper 
	<a href="http://words.werken.com/bob/rete-oo.pdf">The Rete Algorithm for Object-Oriented Language Systems</a>.
