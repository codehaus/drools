  Three actions are added to the right of the view, to customize what is shown:
  <UL>
    <LI>The Show Detail Pane action toggles the detail pane at the bottom of the view.</LI>
    <LI>The Show Logical Structure toggles showing the logical structure of the application data, or all their details.  Logical structures allow for example visualizing sets of elements in a more obvious way.</LI>
    <LI>A drop down contains two actions to toggle the display of constants and static variables.</LI>
