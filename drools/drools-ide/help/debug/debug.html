  <H1>Drools Debugging</H1>
  When debugging an application using a Drools engine, three new views can be used to check the state of the Drools engine itself: the Working Memory View, the Agenda View and the Application Data View. To be able to use these views, either:
  <UL>
    <LI> Create a breakpoint in your code that is calling the WorkingMemory and select the WorkingMemory variable in the Variables debug view
    <LI> Create a breakpoint in the Drools org.drools.reteoo.WorkingMemoryImpl code itself (or any other code that is called from inside WorkingMemoryImpl). For example, the fireAllRules(AgendaFilter agendaFilter) method in the WorkingMemoryImpl class is a good candidate for a breakpoint, because you can pause the engine before firing a rule instance on the agenda.
  </UL>
  Whenever such a breakpoint is encountered, these views show the current state of the engine.
  <UL>
    <LI>The <A href="workingMemory.html">Working Memory</A> shows all elements in the working memory of the Drools engine.</LI>
    <LI>The <A href="agenda.html">Agenda View</A> shows all elements on the agenda. For each rule on the agenda, the rule name and bound variables are shown.</LI>
    <LI>The <A href="applicationData.html">Application Data View</A> shows all application data currently defined in the Drools engine.</LI>
  </UL>
