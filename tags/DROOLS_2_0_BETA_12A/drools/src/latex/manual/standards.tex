\subsection{RuleML}

RuleML is a mark-up language for describing rules.  After brief
research, we decided that supporting RuleML was not a priority.
RuleML tends to focus on \emph{inference rules} and not the
\emph{event-condition-action} or \emph{trigger} rules that
are Drools's primary focus.

\subsection{JSR-94: Java$^{TM}$ Rule Engine API}

JSR-94 is the specification working its way through the Java Community
Process toward defining a common API for rules engines.  The
specification has recently reached the \emph{proposed final draft}
stage.  Drools is provided with an optional module to provide an API
that matches the proposed final draft of the JSR-94 standard.
