      Rules can be a tool for hard-core developers, for business analysts,
      or for someone in between.  Rule primitives need to be tailored
      to the target of the rule authors.  Rule primitives are the parts
      that are put together to for a rule.  Broadly they are categorized
      as <b>rules</b>, <b>conditions</b>, <b>consequences</b> or
      <b>durations</b>.  These components are defined through the
      <a href="TOP/core/spi.html">Semantics Provider Interface</a>.
      The <code>Semantic Module Framework</b> allows for the grouping
      of semantically similar components into a reusable package.

      The modules may be defined by the semantics of a particular computer
      language such as <a href="TOP/java/reference.html">Java</a> or
      <a href="TOP/python/reference.html">Python</a>.  Also, they may
      be defined in terms of higher-level user-centric concepts such
      as <b>email filtering</b> and <b>security control</b>.  Each module
      is typically packaged as a jar that is simply added to the classpath.

      <p>
      Various tools and utilites, such as the <a href="TOP/io/defining.html">I/O subsystem</a>,
      may use the common components to interact with the rule-system.
