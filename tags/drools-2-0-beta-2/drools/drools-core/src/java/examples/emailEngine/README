Email Engine Example

The examples shows how to use a user configuration file in xml along 
with the drools system.  A good reason for using an xml config file
is to seperate the offline processing from say an online web application, 
but this example also shows how to safely generate drools rules 
from XML using XSLT processing.  Because the configuration file
can be validated and the processing uses a standard XSLT script the
final system is IMHO safer than a custom written drools rules 
generator.

The example loads the users xml configuration file and dynamically 
creates the java/xml drools rules.  Then the system creates a 
working rule-engine memory, adds the dynamic rules and asserts
a set of inbound emails.  You should run the example from the 
folder containing build.xml using:
   ./build.pl examples.email_engine

If you have any questions or comments feel free to email the drools
mailing list or contact directly me at martin.hald@bigfoot.com.

Have fun!
