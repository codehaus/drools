  <div class="sectionTitle">Building from source</div>
  <p>
  Previous releases relied upon the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> build-system.
  Unfortunately, the structure of Drools grew to a point that it wasn't conveniently supported
  by Maven.  So, instead of futzing around, we now have a custom bash script to do the builds.
  No, it's not sexy, but it works pretty well.  
  </p>

  <p>
  So, you either need to be using a respectable operation system that includes a bash
  interpreter, else you need to install <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> on 
  your Windows machine.
  </p>

  <p>
  After you've either unpacked a <a href="releases.html">source release</a> or 
  <a href="cvs.html">used CVS to obtain a source tree</a>, locate the <code>buid.sh</code>
  script in the top-level directory.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <code>build.sh</code> is basically a poor man's version of Make. Run the
  <code>build.sh</code> script with zero or more of the following arguments:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>all (the default if no arguments are specified)</li>
    <li>site (build the website)</li>
    <li>javadoc (build the Javadocs)</li>
    <li>compile (build the jars)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The simplest way to build everything is to simply type:
  </p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
./build.sh
</pre>
</div>

  <p>
  When the build completes, a new directory named <code>./build/</code> will
  have been created in the top-level directory of the source tree.  
  </p>

  <p>
  The directory
  <code>./build/lib/</code> contains all constructed jars along with all matching
  dependencies.  Simply deploy all of the produces jars within you \\$CLASSPATH
  to have a fully functional installation.
  </p>

  <p>
  The directory <code>./build/site/</code> contains a full replica of the
  project website, including <a href="TOP/api/index.html">Javadocs</a> and, if possible given the build
  environment, the <a href="">PDF documentation</a>.
  </p>

</div>
