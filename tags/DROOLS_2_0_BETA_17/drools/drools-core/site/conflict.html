      The <a href="TOP/api/org/drools/conflict/SalienceConflictResolver.html">SalienceConflictResolver</a>  
      resolves conflicts between rules by using their <a href="TOP/api/org/drools/rule/Rule.html#getSalience()">salience</a>
      value.  Rules with the same salience will be selected in an arbitrary order.

      The <a href="TOP/api/org/drools/conflict/ComplexityConflictResolver.html">ComplexityConflictResolver</a> resolves
      conflicts between rules based upon the number of conditions, with a rule containing more conditions is given
      priority over one with fewer conditions.  In the event that two conflicting rules have the same complexity
      measure, the resolver falls back to the strategy used by the <code>SalienceConflictResolver</code>.
