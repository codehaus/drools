/**
 * Uses the RuleServiceProviderImpl for Drools to solve the Miss Manners problem.
 *
 * Miss Manners is a program which handles the problem of finding an acceptable
 * seating arrangement for guests at a dinner party.  It will attempt to match
 * people with the same hobbies, and to seat everyone next to a member of the
 * opposite sex.  Manners is a small program, which has only few rules, and
 * employs a depth-first search approach to the problem.
